# common-bugs-uncommon-exploits (WIP)

The repo is a collection of real-world vulnerability examples and uncommon ways to exploit them. It focus on being small and efficient, so it will not contain less exploitable vulnerabilities or stick to existing standards like OWASP or CWE.

Most of the cases are accumulated from the past 10 years and I will continue to update the repo. For now everything would be in mandarin, and the necessity of an english version is pending decision.
